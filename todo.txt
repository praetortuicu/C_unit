#	1.	Intro

1.1	Start: first of all I need to create macro definitions for all the types of
	tests which I want to have -> assertions, comparisons, error throwing (at
	least at first);
1.2	Another thing to think about is how the tool will be used: command line,
	sure, but more like an included header (gotta see how doctest does it).
1.3	Test cases and subcases are a very nice way of structuring the tests, so I
	gotta get that into this thing.
1.4	A very good idea is to check the functions written for dangling pointers and
	such things

2.1	Data Dictionary

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1	Assertions:		for instance variable data types;
	Comparisons:	for instances ranges in which a variable can be;
	Error Throwing:	for instance making sure that the code is throwing a
					specific error -> this will be interesting to handle because
					how?
1.2	Running the tests:	running all the test cases, logging, output, error codes
						and stuff like that
