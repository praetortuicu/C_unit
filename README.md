# Why?

I was working on a different project which, for fucking-around-and-finding-out
reasons I decided to also try and do in C. But I realized I don't have a way to
unit test the code I am writing for that project. So I went ahead to look for a
unit testing framework for good ol' C. There are some nice ones, but none of
them quite hit the spot (the spot being a tool that is really similar to doctest
). So I decided I am gonna fix this massive issue and write a super optimized,
extremely lightweight tool for unit testing C.

# Where?

I want to be able to test modern C, but not only. I want to be able to test
older versions of C, as well as on pretty much anything that can run it. So the
aim is to make this as generic, resource-friendly and small as possible.

# When?

Idk when I have time, I am also studying and have a part-time job so if I can
get in at least a commit a week (on average), I am more than happy.

# How?

Tabs over Spaces.
